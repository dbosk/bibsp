    mobile devices by abusing features of the Wi-Fi standard. This shows that 
        using random {MAC} addresses, on its own, does not guarantee privacy.  
        First, we show that information elements in probe requests can be used 
        to fingerprint devices. We then combine these fingerprints with 
        incremental sequence numbers, to create a tracking algorithm that does 
        not rely on unique identifiers such as {MAC} addresses. Based on 
        real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our algorithm can correctly 
        track as much as 50\% of devices for at least 20 minutes. We also show 
        that commodity Wi-Fi devices use predictable scrambler seeds. These can 
        be used to improve the performance of our tracking algorithm. Finally, 
    we present two attacks that reveal the real {MAC} address of a device, even 
        if {MAC} address randomization is used. In the first one, we create 
          fake hotspots to induce clients to connect using their real {MAC} 
    address. The second technique relies on the new 802.11u standard, commonly 
        referred to as Hotspot 2.0, where we show that Linux and Windows send 
        Access Network Query Protocol ({ANQP}) requests using their real {MAC}

    Crowd counting, which count or accurately estimate the number of human 
        beings within a region, is critical in many applications, such as 
        guided tour, crowd control and marketing research and analysis. A crowd 
        counting solution should be scalable and be minimally intrusive (i.e., 
                                                                         device-free) 
        to users. Image-based solutions are device-free, but cannot work well 
        in a dim or dark environment. Non-image based solutions usually require 
        every human being carrying device, and are inaccurate and unreliable in 
        practice. In this paper, we present FCC, a device-Free Crowd Counting 
        approach based on Channel State Information (CSI). Our design is 
        motivated by our observation that CSI is highly sensitive to 
        environment variation, like a frog eye. We theoretically discuss the 
        relationship between the number of moving people and the variation of 
        wireless channel state. A major challenge in our design of FCC is to 
        find a stable monotonic function to characterize the relationship 
        between the crowd number and various features of CSI. To this end, we 
        propose a metric, the Percentage of nonzero Elements (PEM), in the 
        dilated CSI Matrix. The monotonic relationship can be explicitly 
        formulated by the Grey Verhulst Model, which is used for crowd counting 
        without a labor-intensive site survey. We implement FCC using 
        off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11n devices and evaluate its performance via 
        extensive experiments in typical real-world scenarios. Our results 
        demonstrate that FCC outperforms the state-of-art approaches with much 
        better accuracy, scalability and reliability.

  title={Cross-scene crowd counting via deep convolutional neural networks},

  abstract={
    Cross-scene crowd counting is a challenging task where no laborious data 
        annotation is required for counting people in new target surveillance 
        crowd scenes unseen in the training set. The performance of most existing 
        crowd counting methods drops significantly when they are applied to an 
        unseen scene. To address this problem, we propose a deep convolutional 
        neural network (CNN) for crowd counting, and it is trained alternatively 
        with two related learning objectives, crowd density and crowd count. This 
        proposed switchable learning approach is able to obtain better local 
        optimum for both objectives. To handle an unseen target crowd scene, we 
        present a data-driven method to fine-tune the trained CNN model for the 
        target scene. A new dataset including 108 crowd scenes with nearly 
        200,000 head annotations is introduced to better evaluate the accuracy of 
        cross-scene crowd counting methods. Extensive experiments on the proposed 
        and another two existing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and 
        reliability of our approach.

abstract={Reliable people counting and human detection is an important problem in visual surveillance. In recent years, the field has seen many advances, but the solutions have restrictions: people must be moving, the background must be simple, and the image resolution must be high. This paper aims to develop an effective method for estimating the number of people and locate each individual in a low resolution image with complicated scenes. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, postprocessing steps are performed on background subtraction results to estimate the number of people in a complicated scene, which includes people who are moving only slightly. Second, an Expectation Maximization (EM)-based method has been developed to locate individuals in a low resolution scene. In this method, a new cluster model is used to represent each person in the scene. The method does not require a very accurate foreground contour. Third, the number of people is used as a priori for locating individuals based on feature points. Hence, the methods for estimating the number of people and for locating individuals are connected. The developed methods have been validated based on a 4-hour video, with the number of people in the scene ranging from 36 to 222. The best result for estimating the number of people has an average error of 10% over 51 test cases. Based on the estimated number of people, some results of the EM-based method have also been shown.},
