  abstract={We present a privacy-preserving system for estimating the size of 
    inhomogeneous crowds, composed of pedestrians that travel in different 
        directions, without using explicit object segmentation or tracking.  
        First, the crowd is segmented into components of homogeneous motion, 
    using the mixture of dynamic textures motion model. Second, a set of simple 
        holistic features is extracted from each segmented region, and the 
        correspondence between features and the number of people per segment is 
        learned with Gaussian process regression. We validate both the crowd 
        segmentation algorithm, and the crowd counting system, on a large 
        pedestrian dataset (2000 frames of video, containing 49,885 total 
                            pedestrian instances). Finally, we present results 
        of the system running on a full hour of video.},
