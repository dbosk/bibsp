  abstract = {Existing approaches to cybersecurity emphasize either 
    international s  tate-to-state logics (such as deterrence theory) 
        or the integrity of individual i  nformation systems. Neither 
        provides a good understanding of new “soft cyber” att  acks 
        that involve the manipulation of expectations and common 
        understandings. We   argue that scaling up computer security 
        arguments to the level of the state, so t  hat the entire 
        polity is treated as an information system with associated 
        attack   surfaces and threat models, provides the best 
        immediate way to understand these a  ttacks and how to 
        mitigate them. We demonstrate systematic differences between 
        ho  w autocracies and democracies work as information 
        systems, because they rely on d  ifferent mixes of common and 
        contested political knowledge. Stable autocracies wi  ll have 
        common knowledge over who is in charge and their associated 
        ideological o  r policy goals, but will generate contested 
        knowledge over who the various politi  cal actors in society 
        are, and how they might form coalitions and gain public sup  
        port, so as to make it more difficult for coalitions to 
        displace the regime. Stab  le democracies will have contested 
        knowledge over who is in charge, but common kn  owledge over 
        who the political actors are, and how they may form 
        coalitions and g  ain public support. These differences are 
        associated with notably different attac  k surfaces and 
        threat models. Specifically, democracies are vulnerable to 
        measure  s that “flood” public debate and disrupt shared 
        decentralized understandings of a  ctors and coalitions, in 
        ways that autocracies are not.},
