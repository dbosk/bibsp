\chapter{Authentication}

Authentication concerns ensuring that a claimed property indeed holds.
\Eg in user authentication, the verifier wants to ensure that the user indeed 
corresponds to the claimed identity.
There are, however, a variety of properties that we might be interested in 
verifying.

We need some basic terminology, which happens to be acronyms:
\ac{eID}, \DescribeAcro{eID};
\ac{CA}, \DescribeAcro{CA};
and more generally \iac{PKI}, \DescribeAcro{PKI}.
They are defined as follows.
<<bibsp package content>>=
\DeclareAcronym{eID}{%
  short = {eID},
  short-indefinite = {an},
  long = {electronic ID},
  long-indefinite = {an},
}
\DeclareAcronym{CA}{%
  short = {CA},
  long = {certificate authority},
}
\DeclareAcronym{PKI}{%
  short = {PKI},
  long = {public-key infrastructure},
}

\section{Distance bounding}

\Ac{DB} was first suggested by \textcite{DistanceBounding} as a technique to 
prove that a secret key was within physical proximity.
We provide the acronym \DescribeAcro{DB}
<<bibsp package content>>=
\DeclareAcronym{DB}{%
  short = {DB},
  long = {distance bounding},
  cite = {DistanceBounding},
}
@ which automatically cites the paper:

\subsection{Basic properties}

In their paper, \citeauthor{DistanceBounding} introduce the property \ac{DBDF}, 
\DescribeAcro{DBDF}.
<<bibsp package content>>=
\DeclareAcronym{DBDF}{%
  short = {DF},
  long = {distance fraud},
  cite = {DistanceBounding},

@ They also discuss the property \ac{DBMF}, \DescribeAcro{DBMF}.
<<bibsp package content>>=
\DeclareAcronym{DBMF}{%
  short = {MF},
  short-indefinite = {an},
  long = {Mafia fraud},
  cite = {MafiaFraud},
}
@ However, this property was actually first defined in an earlier paper.

\Textcite{DistanceHijacking} introduced \ac{DBDH}, \DescribeAcro{DBDH}, which is 
an attack against parallel executions of some protocols (or the presence of 
multiple provers).
This attack allows a malicious prover to use an honest prover to do the \ac{DB} 
phase of the protocol.

It's generally difficult to prevent someone from sharing a credential with 
others, \eg a subscription or pass.
However, we can assume that Alice is more reluctant to allow Bob to impersonate 
her forever, than she is to allow Bob to impersonate her only once.
This is captured by \ac{DBTF}, \DescribeAcro{DBTF}.

@

Finally, we have the property of \ac{DBIF}, \DescribeAcro{DBIF}.
This means that a malicious prover can make an honest verifier believe he is 
someone else --- without any help, as in the \ac{DBTF} case.

\subsection{Formal models for \acl{DB}}

There are two (competing) formal models of \ac{DB}:
the \ac{DB-BMV} model, \DescribeAcro{DB-BMV}, and the \ac{DB-DFKO} model, 
\DescribeAcro{DB-DFKO}.

\subsection{Public-key \acl{DB}}

While the majority of \ac{DB} protocols proposed over the years since 
\citeyear{DistanceBounding} have all been symmetric, \ie the verifier must be 
trusted, there are a (very) few works on public-key \ac{DB}.

One scheme in this class is \ac{ProProx}, \DescribeAcro{ProProx}, which is 
\iac{PPK}, \DescribeAcro{PPK}.
(Note that \textcite{ProProx} used \aca{PPK} as acronym.)
<<bibsp package content>>=

\subsection{Physical implementations}

During the \ac{DB} phase, we measure the round-trip time of electromagnetic 
waves.
This means that we must add as little overhead from processing as possible 
during this step.
This means that we need dedicated hardware.

\Textcite{DBonSmartphones} evaluated how well one could do to implement \ac{DB} 
protocols on smartphones without hardware support.

Hardware is starting to come though.
There is 3DB-access\footnote{%
  URL: \url{https://3db-access.com}.
} who provides \iac{DB} chip with \SI{10}{\centi\metre} precision up to 
\SI{150}{\metre}.


\section{Anonymous credentials}

For an anonymous credential system, it is sufficient to have a commitment 
scheme, a signature scheme and (efficient) protocols for
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item proving equality of two committed values;
  \item getting a signature on a committed value; and
  \item proving knowledge of a signature on a committed 
  value~\cite{CLsigs}.
\end{enumerate*}
One such scheme is \ac{CLsigs}, \DescribeAcro{CLsigs}.

  short = {CL-signatures},
  long = {Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signatures},

\Textcite{HowToWinTheCloneWars}, \DescribeBibkey{HowToWinTheCloneWars}, then 
extended this by adding the \ac{DY-VRF} to prevent cloning of anonymous 
credentials for \eg subscriptions.

Finally, \textcite{Psigs} proposed a scheme for non-interactive anonymous 
credentials without the random-oracle model.
The \ac{CLsigs} required the Fiat-Shamir heuristic~\cite{FiatShamirHeuristic} to 
turn the interactive \ac{ZKPK} to non-interactive.

\section{Location-based services}

Another property that we might want to verify is the physical location of 
something.
This is indeed related to \ac{DB} protocols.

\Textcite{PROPS}, \DescribeBibkey{PROPS}, provide a privacy-preserving \ac{LP} 
system, \DescribeAcro{LP}, called \ac{PROPS}, \DescribeAcro{PROPS}.
It's a decentralized system, where a prover collects \acp{LPS}, 
\DescribeAcro{LPS}, from witnesses.

\section{Passwords}

The topic most people associate with authentication is passwords, or 
password-based authentication.

The first paper treats security and usability of password composition policies.
